# EMBO-multi-omics-course
Course material for the EMBO course Integrative analysis of multi-omics data

## Preliminary description

### Practical Day 1: Application of MOFA to a bulk-assay dataset: data setup, calling the method, troubleshooting, results interpretation
Duration: 2 x 1.5h

Tutors/Trainer:  Britta Velten / Ricard Argelaguet and additional helpers from Huber & Stegle group

In a first practical, participants will get familiar with the MOFA method and work with  bulk multi-omics data such as a data set on leukemia samples covering RNA-seq, methylation, drug response and genomic data. Here, participants will learn how to prepare and normalize the data for an integrative analysis and what data containers can be useful (e.g., MultiAssayExperiment). Once set up, the practical will show how to call the method on the data, make use of basic options and address any issues that can arise. In groups of 3-4 people, the participants will then discover different ways to interpret the results and perform different kinds of down-stream analyses, such as enrichment analysis, clustering, outlier detection. TBD: Second part of the tutorial might add tutorials on related factor methods and integration strategies by other speakers and trainers

### Practical Day 2:  Single cell multi-omics integration using muon
Duration: 1h + 2h

Tutors/Trainer:  Danila Bredikhin / Ricard Argelaguet / Ilia Kats and additional helpers from Huber & Stegle group

In a second practical, participants will learn how to use the muon framework for multi-modal analysis of single cell data, covering important data formats for single cell data, normalization strategies, clustering and visualization. In groups of 3-4 people, they will apply this framework for the analysis of multimodal single cell data such as CITE-seq or scNMT-seq data. During this, they will learn about weightest nearest neighbors analysis and discover more advanced options of the MOFA method from day 1 such as integration of data with distinct groups of samples and learn how it can be interfaced with the muon framework. 

### Practical Day 3: Applications to student-selected or own data and further extensions
Duration: 1h + 2h + 1h

Tutors/Trainer: Britta Velten / Ricard Argelaguet / Danila Bredikhin / Ilia Kats and additional helpers  from Huber & Stegle group

In a third session, participants will have the opportunity to work on their own data or select a dataset of interest. Here, they can implement the learnt strategies for data integration for the data set at hand and prepare a reproducible analysis vignette to interpret the results obtained. At all stages they will receive feedback and recommendations by the trainers and are encouraged to exchange and team up with participants working on related data. Everyone is expected to present the results of their analysis at the end of the course to the other participants.
