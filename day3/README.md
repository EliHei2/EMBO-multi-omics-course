# Day 3: Integrative analysis of droplet-based single-cell and spatial data

_Topics_: spatial data, pre-processing, scRNA-seq, horizontal/batch integration, data visualisation, mosaic integration
_Duration_: 3x 1h

## Install instruction

### Python

Create a new virtutal environment using your favorite package manager (e.g. Conda or Mamba).

```
mamba create --prefix $HOME/conda-py310 python==3.10 jupyter jupyterlab spatialdata scanpy scikit-misc
```

Activate the environment

```
source activate $HOME/conda-py310
```

and install the additional packages

```
pip install scanorama harmonypy bbknn scib-metrics scvi-tools squidpy
```

via `pip`. Start `jupyter lab` in the folder where you have downloaded the course materials.

```
jupyter lab
```

### R

Please install the latest version of R and RStudio and Python. The following R instruction should also be executed to install additional needed packages:

```
install.packages(c("data.table", "tidyverse", "BiocManager", "ggplot2", "RColorBrewer", "plotly", "patchwork", "ggiraph", "grDevices", "S4Vectors"))
```

followed by

```
BiocManager::install(c("MOFA2", "MOFAdata", "zellkonverter", "bluster", "batchelor", "scuttle", "scran", "BiocNeighbors", "SingleCellExperiment"))
```

## Outline

### Part 1: Introduction to `spatialdata` (Elyas Heidari)

### Part 2: Horizontal data integration (Harald VÃ¶hringer)

This notebook demonstrates the integration of Xenium and scFFPE-seq data from a serial formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human breast cancer section. We first analyse both datasets independently and perform mild preprocessing of the data. Then, we apply a range of different integration tools to jointly embed the data on the set of genes which are present in both datasets.

### Part 3: Mosaic integration (Shila Ghazanfar)

This workshop assumes that there exists a folder named `data` immediately above this repository folder. Within the `data` folder there should be two main data files: scFFPE_raw.h5ad and xenium_rep1.h5ad. These can be downloaded from the following links:
